<h3>TwitterTestStuff</h3>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Testing random twitter data with natural language toolkit with goal of learning social data mining and using it for applications to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio">StatsForStocks</a> code. As of now it is doing _nothing_ but a simple calculation of lexical diversity of top tweets. This is currently pre-pre-alpha state, and I do not plan to work on it till basic structure of StatsForStocks is complete. However, in case you decide to give it a try (Seriously...there is absolutely nothing in there yet) and have any suggestions for improvements, do add them in issues.</p>
